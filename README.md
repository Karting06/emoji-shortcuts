Keyboard codes
==============

I’m not a fan of searching Emoji through a menu, I prefer a keyboard! Because I
have noticed that some keyboard shortcuts render another Emoji on different
platforms, I made a list.

 

I also added the meaning from Emojipedia, because it can sometimes be useful...

 

This list is not exhaustive, and those are the shortcuts that I found. If I
missed someone, feel free to make a pull request :).

At the moment, I have only tested Hangouts and Facebook Messenger. Twitter (on
Desktop website) doesn’t render Emoji’s on tweets when using keyboard shortcuts.
